## General Information <a name="general-information"></a>

- Due to the nature of our mobile app, we are required to restrict access to individuals aged 18 and above, ensuring compliance with state laws regarding age requirements.

## Room for Improvement <!-- Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development. -->
- Given that this is a course project, we have limited time to develop it to our full vision. Nevertheless, our goal is to develop a functional, user-friendly mobile app that offers information about nightclubs in the Austin area. If we choose to pursue this project beyond the classroom, we aspire to broaden its reach, potentially extending the database across the country for a more expansive impact.
- Additionally, if we were to continue working on this project beyond the classroom, we will try to find additional resources like more time, expertise in specific areas, and potentially additional developers could help in expanding its scope statewide.
- User feedback and engagement would be crucial in fine-tuning and enhancing the app's features and functionalities. Therefore, we also would like to gather feedback from fellow Texas State students through beta testing.
