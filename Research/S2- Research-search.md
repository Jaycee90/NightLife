## Research on search components

**Title**: Research on Search Functionality Enhancement.

**Why**: We are conducting this research to enhance the search functionality of our web-based app. This improvement is essential for helping customers discover nearby clubs that align with their preferences and interests, ultimately delivering a better user experience.

**Expectations**: 

* We expect to learn about modern search algorithms, techniques, and libraries that can improve the efficiency and accuracy of our search functionality.

* Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training.

**Actions**:

* What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  

* Be specific.  

* For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   

* "Writing the Login class" is.
